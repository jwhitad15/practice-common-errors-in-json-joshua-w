üè® JSON Syntax Debugging: Hotel Booking Data
===========================================

üéØ Objective:
Students will analyze a JSON file containing multiple syntax errors,
identify the issues, and correct them.

This activity helps practice spotting and fixing common JSON mistakes such as:
- Missing commas
- Incorrect use of quotation marks
- Unmatched brackets/braces
- Trailing commas
- Invalid data types

/*
üìò Scenario:
You‚Äôre a developer on a team building a travel booking API.

A teammate submitted a JSON file to represent a hotel booking, 
but it contains multiple syntax errors that prevent it from being parsed.

üîß Your Task:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Review the provided JSON file
2Ô∏è‚É£ Identify all syntax errors
3Ô∏è‚É£ Write down what each error is and why it causes a problem
4Ô∏è‚É£ Correct the JSON structure so that it is valid
5Ô∏è‚É£ Validate your corrected version using a JSON linter or validator

üß™ Deliverables:
- A corrected version of the JSON
- A list of the corrections made and why each was necessary

  "checkInDate": "2024-05-15",
  "checkOutDate": "2024-05-20",

  }
}

// LIST OF CHANGES MADE (TOP-TO-BOTTOM)
// delete [entire const invalidBookingJSON = `] row (this is JavaScript)
// delete backtick after invalidBookingJSN (doesn't require backticks in syntax structure)
// add comma after "checkInDate" value (must separate the objects from each other)
// add quotations to "name" key of the first guest (JSON rules say so)
// change the value of "age" from undefined to null in the second guest (JSON doesn't accept undefined as a value)
// remove the comma after "Parking" in the amenities array (no trailing commas)
// remove the backtick between the last closing brace and the semicolon (doesn't require backticks in syntax structure)
// remove semicolon at the end of code (semicolons aren't necessary in JSON)

/*
- Use a JSON validator or linter (e.g., https://jsonlint.com/) to test your final version
- Keep track of each fix:
  ‚Ä¢ What was wrong?
  ‚Ä¢ Why is it a problem in JSON?
  ‚Ä¢ What did you change to fix it?

/*
üí¨ Reflect and answer the following:

1Ô∏è‚É£ What tools or techniques did you use to identify the errors?

2Ô∏è‚É£ How did you confirm that your corrected JSON file was valid?

3Ô∏è‚É£ Which errors were the most difficult to spot? Why?

4Ô∏è‚É£ What strategies can help you avoid these kinds of errors in the future?
   (e.g., syntax highlighting, linters, writing JSON by example)
