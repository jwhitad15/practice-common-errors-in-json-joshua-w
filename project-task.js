/*
===========================================
🏨 JSON Syntax Debugging: Hotel Booking Data
===========================================

🎯 Objective:
Students will analyze a JSON file containing multiple syntax errors,
identify the issues, and correct them.

This activity helps practice spotting and fixing common JSON mistakes such as:
- Missing commas
- Incorrect use of quotation marks
- Unmatched brackets/braces
- Trailing commas
- Invalid data types
*/


// ============================================
// 🧭 Instructions:
// ============================================

/*
📘 Scenario:
You’re a developer on a team building a travel booking API.

A teammate submitted a JSON file to represent a hotel booking, 
but it contains multiple syntax errors that prevent it from being parsed.

🔧 Your Task:
1️⃣ Review the provided JSON file
2️⃣ Identify all syntax errors
3️⃣ Write down what each error is and why it causes a problem
4️⃣ Correct the JSON structure so that it is valid
5️⃣ Validate your corrected version using a JSON linter or validator

🧪 Deliverables:
- A corrected version of the JSON
- A list of the corrections made and why each was necessary

  "hotelName": "Grand City Hotel",
  "checkInDate": "2024-05-15",
  "checkOutDate": "2024-05-20",

    "amenities": ["WiFi", "Breakfast", "Parking"]
  }
}

// LIST OF CHANGES MADE (TOP-TO-BOTTOM)
// delete [entire const invalidBookingJSON = `] row (this is JavaScript)
// delete backtick after invalidBookingJSN (doesn't require backticks in syntax structure)
// add comma after "checkInDate" value (must separate the objects from each other)
// add quotations to "name" key of the first guest (JSON rules say so)
// change the value of "age" from undefined to null in the second guest (JSON doesn't accept undefined as a value)
// remove the comma after "Parking" in the amenities array (no trailing commas)
// remove the backtick between the last closing brace and the semicolon (doesn't require backticks in syntax structure)
// remove semicolon at the end of code (semicolons aren't necessary in JSON)

/*
- Use a JSON validator or linter (e.g., https://jsonlint.com/) to test your final version
- Keep track of each fix:
  • What was wrong?
  • Why is it a problem in JSON?
  • What did you change to fix it?
*/


// ============================================
// 🤔 Follow-Up Questions
// ============================================

/*
💬 Reflect and answer the following:

1️⃣ What tools or techniques did you use to identify the errors?

2️⃣ How did you confirm that your corrected JSON file was valid?

3️⃣ Which errors were the most difficult to spot? Why?

4️⃣ What strategies can help you avoid these kinds of errors in the future?
   (e.g., syntax highlighting, linters, writing JSON by example)
